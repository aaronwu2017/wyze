User Interface when Cart is open. As depicted at right, Cart component can fetch and
parse data(JSON) from the database, then allow users to manipulate data(i.e., change quantity)
in the floating shopping cart. At upper left, Banner component displays a headline image. At
lower left, users can browse the products and add them to the database, using Productlist
component. Shoppingcart component is the parent component for the other three component.
